#================================================================
# Notes : 
# Ferret provides symbols with one underscore. This is the case
# for symbols with prefix ef needed to compile external functions.
# Thus, compilation must be executed with option -fno-second-underscore  
# On the other side, if libnetcdf.a provides symbols with two underscores, 
# you must then transform in the code all calls to netCDF API by adding 
# a single underscore to form symbols with two underscores at the compilation.
# Symbols NF_XXXX( are transformed to symbols NF_XXXX_(
# 
# In this case, pass the following line :
# sed -e "s/\(NF_[A-Z_]*\)(/\1_(/g" fast_sample_xy_subs.F.init > fast_sample_xy_subs.F
